## Introduction question and what we found interesting
### How the pandemic affected our normal lives and how to prepare for potential future pandemic spread?
### In the first two years of the pandemic, COVID-19 was identified as the third leading cause of death in the United States, trailing only heart disease and cancer.

## Data was obtained through excel files from the CDC official website.
### Some of the main factors we looked for were covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations, age groups, and administered vaccine doses

### Covid Data 1 Steps

#### 1- Find the relationship between age group and Covid-19 deaths
#### 2- Ignore gender and add the total Covid-19 deaths for all three years. Seperating them by age group. Make a dataframe showing age group and Covid-19 Deaths. Save the new dataframe into a .csv.
#### 3- Make a bar graph, x-axis is the different age groups, y-axis is the total deaths. Save the graph as a .png.
#### 4- Perform Chi-Sqaured test for age group and Covid-19 deaths to test significance of the data. 


### Covid Data 2 Steps

#### 1- Find the relationship between underlying conditions and Covid-19 deaths.
#### 2- Import data into a dataframe and clean the dataframe to show total Covid-19 deaths for each underlying condition for all three years. Save the new dataframe into a .csv.
#### 3- Make a bar graph, x-axis is the different underlying conditions, y-axis is the total deaths. Save the graph as a .png.
